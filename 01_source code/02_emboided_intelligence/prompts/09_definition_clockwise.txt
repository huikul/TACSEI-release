Definitions of clockwise and counterclockwise motions from the camera perspective:

__Clockwise motion__: The reference symbol rotates in the sequence of positions: __top-right-down-left-top__, completing the circular motion.
__Counterclockwise motion__: The reference symbol rotates in the sequence of positions: __top-left-down-right-top__, completing the circular motion.

__Steps to Analyze:__
    a) Identify a fixed symbol or feature on the object that moves consistently across the frames.
    b) Observe the rotation of this symbol relative to the top, left, right, and bottom sides of the frame.
    c) Match the observed motion to the definitions of clockwise or counterclockwise.
