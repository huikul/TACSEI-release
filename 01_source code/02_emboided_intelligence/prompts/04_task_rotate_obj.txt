3. Task description:
Generate a signal sequence for each finger (Thumb - TH, First Finger - FF, and Middle Finger - MF) to rotate a cynlinder object towards the thumb (TH).

3.1 Signal Arrays:
Save the air pressure values for each finger in separate arrays:
    a) sig_th for the Thumb
    b) sig_ff for the First Finger
    c) sig_mf for the Middle Finger
    d) return only excutable Python code to generate the sequences, without useless strings.

3.2 Sequence Properties:
    a) The length of signal sequence for each finger must be the 500.
    b) Air pressure values should remain within the range of 0 to 0.64 bar.
    c) The signal sequences for related fingers must contain cyclic variations in air pressure.
    d) Each cycle must consist of 20 data points for smooth air pressure modulation.
    
    
3.3 Expected Behavior:
    a) Introduce cyclic variations in the air pressure of TH and FF to generate rotational torque, maintaining grip stability.
    b) Ensure the force applied by the TH and FF is coordinated to rotate the object toward the TH.
