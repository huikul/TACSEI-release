3. Task description:
Generate a signal sequence for each finger (Thumb - TH, First Finger - FF, and Middle Finger - MF) to swing an object __toward the TH side__.

3.1 Signal Arrays:
Save the air pressure values for each finger in separate arrays:
    a) sig_th for the Thumb
    b) sig_ff for the First Finger
    c) sig_mf for the Middle Finger
    d) return only excutable Python code to generate the sequences, without useless strings.

3.2 Sequence Properties:
    a) The length of signal sequence for each finger must be the 200.
    b) Air pressure values should remain within the range of 0 to 0.64 bar.
    c) Smooth the control signal after generation.
    
3.3 Expected Behavior:
    a) Gradually increase air pressure for all fingers to grip the object.
    b) Maintain the pose for a short duration.
    c) Adjust air pressure to ensure coordinated movement, swinging the object __toward the TH side__.
    d) Maintain the pose briefly after swinging to stabilize the object, until the end.
