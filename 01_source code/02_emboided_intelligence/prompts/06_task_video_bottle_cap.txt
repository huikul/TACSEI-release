3. Task description:
Based on the demostration result, generate signal sequences for each finger—Thumb (TH), First Finger (FF), and Middle Finger (MF)—to __rotate__ a bottle cap for either __opening or closing__.

3.1 Signal Arrays:
Save the air pressure values for each finger in separate arrays:
    a) __sig_th for the Thumb__
    b) __sig_ff for the First Finger__
    c) __sig_mf for the Middle Finger__
    d) return only excutable Python code to generate the sequences, without useless strings.

3.2 Sequence Properties:
    a) The length of signal sequence for each finger must be the 500.
    b) Air pressure values should remain within the range of __0 to 0.64__ bar.
    c) The signal sequences for related fingers must contain cyclic variations in air pressure.
    d) Each cycle must consist of 20 data points for smooth air pressure modulation.

3.3 Considering the space relationship between the soft hand and bottle cap:
    a) __Open: Rotate toward the Thumb (TH)__.
    b) __Close: Rotate toward the First Finger (FF)__.
    c) Using the __Rotation Strategy__ in previous prompt in __2.3.7__ to achieve the rotation.
    
3.4 Expected Behavior:
    a) Introduce cyclic variations in the air pressure of TH and FF to generate rotational torque, maintaining grip stability.
    b) Ensure that the force/torque applied by TH and FF is coordinated to rotate the object in the required direction __opening or closing__ as the demostration result.
