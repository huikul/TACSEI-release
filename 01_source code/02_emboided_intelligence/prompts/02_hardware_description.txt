2. Hardware description:

2.1 Gripper Design:
2.1.1 The gripper is a humanoid right hand in a pre-grasp pose with three soft, silicone fingers:
   a) Thumb (TH): Positioned on the right side of the palm.
   b) First Finger (FF): Positioned on the left side of the plam.
   c) Middle Finger (MF): Positioned below the FF, on the same side.
2.1.2 The TH and FF are opposite each other, while the MF aligns directionally with the FF.
2.1.3 Each finger has multiple air chambers that can be independently actuated using compressed air.
2.1.4 Action Mechanism: Inflating the chambers with compressed air causes the fingers to bend inward, enabling them to grasp objects.

2.2 Sensing ability:
2.2.1 Each finger has a 4x8 tactile sensor array on its surface towards the target object to detect contact forces when interacting with an object.
2.2.2 Sensors embedded between the air chambers measure forces generated during inflation, providing real-time feedback on finger states.

2.3 Control strategies:

2.3.1 Pressure Range: Air pressure values range from 0 to 0.64 bar.
2.3.2 Gripping Threshold: Fingers typically close and grip an object when the air pressure reaches approximately 0.4 bar.
2.3.3 Smooth Transitions: Avoid sharp changes in air pressure for stability and precise control.
2.3.4 Force Modulation: 
    a) Adjusting real-time air pressure for each finger enables fine-grained control of the gripping force.
    b) Higher air pressure results in greater force applied toward the object.
2.3.5 Finger Control: Independent control of the Thumb (TH), First Finger (FF), and Middle Finger (MF) allows for precise manipulation.
2.3.6 Common Operations:
    a) Gripping (Grasping): Securely hold objects by inflating all active fingers to ~0.4 bar.
    b) Rotating: Adjust coordinated signals for the TH and FF while keeping the MF inactive (pressure = 0 bar).
    c) Swinging: Manipulate pressure across the fingers to tilt or swing the grasped object in a specific direction.
2.3.7 Rotation Strategy:
    a) Use TH and FF to rotate a cylindrical object.
    b) Maintain a stable grip pressure, averaging 0.3 to 0.4 bar for both fingers.
    c) Keep the MF inactive (0 bar pressure).
    d) Introduce a __0.5-cycle phase difference and an amplitude difference (0.15 ~ 0.25 bar)  between the TH and FF signals__.
    e) __Larger average pressure and amplitude in the TH__ signal rotates the object __toward the TH__.
    f) __Larger average pressure and amplitude in the FF__ signal rotates the object __toward the FF__.
    
2.3.8 Swinging Strategy:
    a) Adjust pressure among the fingers to swing the object:
    b) Toward __FF/MF__: Increase pressure on the __TH and MF__. Largely decrease pressure on the __FF__.
    c) Toward __TH__: Increase pressure on the __FF__. Largely decrease pressure on the __TH and MF__.
